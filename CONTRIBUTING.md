## Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are always welcome!

Before submitting new features or changes to current functionality, it is recommended to first
[open an issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make.

### Building

In order to build and test this whole repository you need JDK 11+.

Some instrumentations and tests may put constraints on which java versions they support.
See [Running the tests](./docs/contributing/running-tests.md) for more details.

#### Snapshot builds

For developers testing code changes before a release is complete, there are
snapshot builds of the `main` branch. They are available from
the Sonatype OSS snapshots repository at `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`
([browse](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/opentelemetry/))

#### Building from source

Build using Java 11+:

```bash
java -version
```

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

and then you can find the java agent artifact at

`javaagent/build/libs/opentelemetry-javaagent-<version>.jar`.

### Troubleshooting PR build failures

The build logs are very long and there is a lot of parallelization, so the logs can be hard to
decipher, but if you scroll to the bottom you should see something like:

```
Publishing build scan...
https://gradle.com/s/ila4qwp5lcf5s
```

Opening the build scan link can sometimes take several seconds (it's a large build), but it
typically makes it a lot clearer what's failing.
